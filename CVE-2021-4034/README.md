`b64load.c` is not really needed. It's here for demonstration purpose. The source in this file is base64 encoded and stored as a string in `exploit.c`.

To test if this attack is possible, compile and execute `exploit.c`.

```
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
./exploit
```

If attack is successful, you'll get a root shell, otherwise, you get following error message.
`GLib: Cannot convert message: Could not open converter from “UTF-8” to “PWNKIT”`
